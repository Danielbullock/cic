### Introduction
There comes a time where logic and looping become useful. Ansible provides conditional constructs to cater for this.

Conditionals allow the result of a play to vary based on the value of variables, or the results of previous tasks.

### Learning Objectives

How to use Conditionals to add logic to Playbooks.

## Prerequisite knowledge

It is assumed that you are familiar with the basics of Ansible, such that you can define a simple Playbook.

*Note:* Before going any further do the following:

- `cd YOUR_CLONE_OF_THIS REPO`
- `source ./bin/env`
- `cd ./exercises/IaC/ansible/roles`

Run `cic up` to bring up all the test infrastructure and support files required to complete this exercise. To stop and reset this infrastructure run `cic down`.

## Tutorial

### The When Statement

The When Statement defines the condition for **when** a certain action should happen.

The condition is declared within the task itself using the when clause:

```
tasks:
  - name: example task
    when: a condition is met
```

<%
 example_logic_path = 'ansible/logic_examples.yml'
 required_variable_name = 'installation_dir'
 optional_variable_name = 'log_level'
 example_logic_yaml=<<YAML
---
- name: setup environment
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Runtime requirements check
    fail: msg="Required variable '{{ #{required_variable_name} }}' not set"
    when: #{required_variable_name} is undefined

  - name: Setup runtime
    shell: echo "Logging at '{{ #{optional_variable_name} }}'"
    when: log_evel is defined

YAML
%>

The following example declares 2 tasks:
- `Runtime requirements check` - This will fail if the `<%= required_variable_name%>` variable is not supplied
- `Setup runtime` - which outputs a message if the `<%= optional_variable_name%>` variable is supplied.


Write this example yaml to file to so that you can try running it `<%= write_to_file(example_logic_path, example_logic_yaml) %>`

```
<%= example_logic_yaml %>
```

In this example the when clause is defined using a `test`. There are many ways you can utilise tests to define your conditionals, more information can be found [here.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/user_guide/playbooks_tests.html)

Running `<%= command("ansible-playbook #{example_logic_path} -c local", fail_on_error: false)%>`, i.e. not supplying the required `<%= required_variable_name %>` causes the first of our tasks to fail:
```
<%= last_command_output%>
```

We can fix this by supplying the `<%= required_variable_name %>` using the the `--extra-vars` option. I.e run `<%= command("ansible-playbook #{example_logic_path} -c local --extra-vars='#{required_variable_name}=/var'")%>`
```
<%= last_command_output %>
```

You'll notice that this time the playbook executed successfully but that the `Setup runtime` task did not execute. This is because we did not supply the optional `<%= optional_variable_name%>` variable. Run: `<%= command("ansible-playbook #{example_logic_path} -c local --extra-vars='#{required_variable_name}=/var #{optional_variable_name}=debug'")%>` to see the `Setup runtime`
task execute.
```
<%= last_command_output%>
```

<%
 example_or_yaml=<<YAML
---
- name: Global working hours
  hosts: all
  vars:
    day: Saturday
    time: 17:00

  tasks:
  - debug:
      msg: "No one will be available globally in the office till Monday 01:00 GMT"
    when: day=="Saturday" or day=="Sunday"
YAML
 example_and_yaml=<<YAML
---
- name: Global working hours
  hosts: all
  vars:
    day: Monday
    time: 17:00

  tasks:
  - debug:
      msg: "No one will be available globally in the office till 01:00 GMT"
    when: day=="Monday" and time>=5
YAML
%>

To combine multiple conditions you can make use of 'or' and 'and', where the play will execute if one of the conditons is met, or if both of the conditions are met, respectively.

Rewrite your file to `<%= write_to_file(example_logic_path, example_or_yaml) %>` with the following yaml so that you can try running it:

```
<%= example_or_yaml %>
```

Running `<%= command("ansible-playbook #{example_logic_path} -c local")%>`, will print the statement as one of the two conditions are met.

```
<%= last_command_output%>
```

Alternatively, we can require both conditions to be met. Overwrite your yaml, `<%= write_to_file(example_logic_path, example_and_yaml) %>`, with the following yaml:

```
<%= example_and_yaml %>
```

Running `<%= command("ansible-playbook #{example_logic_path} -c local")%>`, will now print an alternative message for a weekday that indicates no one will be in the office till the following morning.

```
<%= last_command_output%>
```


### Exercise

You are in a team who is required to install Apache on a selection of servers. These servers all have different operating systems. Make use of the when statement and looping to write a playbook that iterates through the servers and installs Apache in the corresponding manner.

Hints:
Apache has a different package name in Ubuntu and CentOS.

```
---
- hosts: webserver
  become: sudo
  tasks:
    - mame: install apache2
      yum:
        name:
        state: latest
      apt:
        name:
        state: latest

when: ansible_distribution == 'Debian' or ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
```
